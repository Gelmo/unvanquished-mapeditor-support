Unvanquished support for JackHammer
===================================

Installation
------------

JackHammer does not know what is a gamepack.

You must download the [fgd file](/build/jackhammer/install/unvanquished.fgd) yourself and configure JackHammer to use it.

You can follow this [Tremulous tutorial](http://jack.hlfx.ru/en/articles/4/jack_trem.html) and adapt it for Unvanquished.

Using
-----

The Unvanquished base game directory is named `pkg`.
